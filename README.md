# IFRC Marrakech Data Automation Scripts

These scripts were developed as part of an internship at **IFRC Marrakech** (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies). Their purpose is to automate and accelerate repetitive data processing, cleaning, and deduplication tasks, making daily work easier and more efficient for staff.

## Project Context
During my internship at IFRC Marrakech, I observed that staff spent significant time manually processing large and messy datasets. These scripts were created to:
- **Automate normalization and deduplication** of data (with fuzzy matching and user confirmation)
- **Output clean, sorted files** ready for further analysis or integration

## Impact
These scripts were instrumental during my internship at IFRC Marrakech, enabling the team to:
- Clean and organize large datasets in minutes instead of days
- Ensure consistency and accuracy in records
- Focus on higher-value tasks by automating repetitive data cleaning
